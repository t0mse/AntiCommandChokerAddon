## Introduction
Like many experienced Minecraft players out there, I've had the problem of<br>
mistyping commands with a "7" instead of the actual "/" in chat.

Especially with private messages, it is annoying when all other players see that<br>
you wanted to tell your friend that you where the one who stole the cookie jar. (⌐■_■)

Since I've been programming for a long time, especially with Java, I put 1 and 1<br>
together and developed this [LabyMod](https://labymod.net) addon to let you keep your secrets as well. (¬‿¬)

## Installation
Here you can see how to install the addon step by step:
- Download the addon `.jar` file [here](https://github.com/t0mse)
- Move the `.jar` file in the `.minecraft/LabyMod/addons-1.8` folder
- Start/restart your game with LabyMod

## Supported Versions
Currently, this addon is only available for LabyMod-3 with the Minecraft version 1.8.9
